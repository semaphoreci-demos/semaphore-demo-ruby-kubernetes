# This pipeline is the entry point of Semaphore.

# An agent defines the environment in which your code runs.
# It is a combination of one of available machine types and operating
# system images. See:

# Blocks are the heart of a pipeline and are executed sequentially.
# Each block has a task that defines one or more jobs. Jobs define the
# commands to execute.
# See https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/62-concepts
blocks:
  - name: Install dependencies
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: bundle install
          commands:
            # Checkout code from Git repository. This step is mandatory if the
            # job is to work with your code.
            # Optionally you may use --use-cache flag to avoid roundtrip to
            # remote repository.
            # See https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/54-toolbox-reference#libcheckout
            - checkout

            # Restore dependencies from cache, command won't fail if it's
            # missing.
            # More on caching: https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/54-toolbox-reference#cache
            - cache restore gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gemfile.lock),gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH,gems-master
            - bundle install --deployment --path .bundle
            # Store the latest version of dependencies in cache,
            # to be used in next blocks and future workflows:
            - cache store gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gemfile.lock) .bundle

  - name: Tests
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: rspec
          commands:
            - checkout
            - cache restore gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gemfile.lock),gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH,gems-master
            # Bundler requires `install` to run even though cache has been
            # restored, but generally this is not the case with other package
            # managers. Installation will not actually run and command will
            # finish quickly:
            - bundle install --deployment --path .bundle
            # Run unit tests:
            - bundle exec rspec

# If all tests pass, we move on to build a Docker image.
# This is a job for a separate pipeline which we link with a promotion.
#
# What happens outside semaphore.yml will not appear in GitHub pull
# request status report.
#
# In this example we run docker build automatically on every branch.
# You may want to limit it by branch name, or trigger it manually.
# For more on such options, see:
